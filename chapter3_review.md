## 1.What does it mean to preempt a process?

 To take a resource away from a process. One such resource is the CPU, and in fact preempt often
means to move a process from RUNNING state to READY state. The process involuntarily gives up the
CPU. 

## 2. What is swapping and what is its purpose?

To maximize the number of processes in the system, we swap a process from the ready state to
the ready suspend state.

## 3.List three general categories of information in a process control block.

Process identification: id of this process, id of the parent process and user id.
Processor state information: program counter, status registers, and general-purpose
registers.
Process control information:
a. Scheduling & state information: process state, priority, scheduling-related
information (amount of time waiting and time being executed), event
(identity of event the process is awaiting before can be resumed)
b. Data structuring: a process may be linked to other process in a queue.
c. Memory management: include pointers to page tables that describe the
virtual memory assigned
d. Resource ownership and utilization
e. Process privileges: e.g. the memory that may be accessed, types of
instructions that may be executed and the use of system utilities and
services
f. Interprocess communication

## 4. Why are two modes (user and kernel) needed?

kernel mode needs direct access to hardware and reference memory, protection needed in user mode.

## 5. What is the difference between an interrupt and a trap?

A trap is an exception in a user process. It's caused by division by zero or invalid memory access. 
It's also the usual way to invoke a kernel routine (a system call) because those run with a higher 
priority than user code. Handling is synchronous. In a sense they are active most of the time, the 
code expects the trap to happen and relies on this fact.

An interrupt is something generated by the hardware. These are asynchronous or passive since the 
interrupt handler has to wait for them to happen eventually.

## 6.  Give three examples of an interrupt.

Generally there are three types o Interrupts those are Occurred For Example
1)   Internal Interrupt

2)   Software Interrupt.

3)   External Interrupt.

## 7. What is the difference between a mode switch and a process switch?

A mode switch may occur without changing the state of the process that is currently
in the Running state. A process context switch involves taking the currently executing
process out of the Running state in favor of another process. The process context
switch involves saving more state information.
